# IELTS Website using React

A modern, responsive web app built with React. It features a modular component structure focusing on clarity, maintainability, and user experience.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git  
   cd your-repo

2. **Install dependencies**  
   npm install

3. **Run the project locally**  
   npm start

4. **Build for production**  
   npm run build


## Design Choices

- **React for modularity:** Components like Navbar, Hero, Cards, and Footer are separated for easy reuse and maintenance.  
- **CSS + Bootstrap:** Ensures responsiveness and consistent styling across different screen sizes.  
- **Asset management:** Images and icons are stored locally for faster load times and easier updates.  
- **Clean layout & UX focus:** Grid and card structures keep the interface intuitive and visually appealing.

**I used a minimalistic design approach for elegancy.**
**I have mainly used 4 colours [ Cream(#F4FEC1), Mindaro(#D9F9A5), Citron(#D2D68D), Wenge(#68534D) ] for designing my website and simple animated images.**
